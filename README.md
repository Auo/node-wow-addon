## INFO
A node-module to install addons for World of Warcraft.

## TODO
* scan addon-folder for installed addons ( difficult since the titles of the addons are not the same as on the portals ( doesn't have to be ))
* filter away addon-packs on wowinterface.( the addon-packs will not be installed correctly, maybe let the user decide upon this?)
* filter away addon-packs on curse ( doesn't seem to be any when you don't use the client)
